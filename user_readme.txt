With this game you can play a game with another user.
This game is a basic guessing game. 
You will guess a number and your enemy will guess one. 
Which player's number is closer to server random number, that player wins a round.
Whoever reaches 2 round wins, wins game.

You can check your point and other players point with user list.

TO PLAY GAME : 
First you need to know the server IP and listening port.
After connecting server with a one-word name you are in the game lobby.
Note: Please use one word name to avoid bugs and you can not choose a game already exists in game lobby.

After connecting lobby 
You can request a player list to see which players are connected to game and corresponding points near their name
You can invite a player to play game. If enemy is not receiving invitations or not in game. 
If enemy player rejects your request do not worry, you can invite another player or retry after few seconds.
If enemy player accepts your request real game starts.

You need to make a guess. 
If you want to play jedi mindtricks to your enemy, you can wait until a guess come from enemy.
After you see the guess info you can guess, or you can be impatient and smash guess button (but only once, it will close until round ends :) )
If your enemy is slowpoke and boring you with long guess times, you can surrender but you will lose game.
Do not worry you will not lose points if you lose game,but enemy will win a point.
If you need to catch last shuttle at 23.00 from Kadiköy to Sabanci but playing a hot game between your nemesis
you can directly disconnect from disconnect button and end game.
But please do everything but not close from windows form X button unless you want to be a zombie. 
It may make server so sad that it can not delete you from gamelobby.

Have fun playing, good guessing :^)
